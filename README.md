# pop-up-quiz
A JavaScript quiz

## Description
I needed more time on this assigment to work out my styling issues and continue editing my JS. I am submitting what I have currently but plan to resubmit this assignment. 

- My motivation for this assigment was to combine what I had learned in JS in addition to what I have learned about APIs. The final product was supposed to be a pop-up quiz with a working timer and questions.
